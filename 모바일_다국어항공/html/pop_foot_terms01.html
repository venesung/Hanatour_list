						<strong>Article 10 (Change of Airfare)</strong>
						<p>Before a Traveler requests air ticketing and pays for Airline Tickets, in the event that the airfare is increased or decreased since a Traveler has made a reservation, the Company or Traveler may request the other party to increase or decrease the airfare within the scope of such an increased or decreased amount.

						<strong>Article 11 (Issuance of Terms and Conditions)</strong>

						② In the event that an airline seat reservation of which the status in 'Waiting' is not 'Confirmed', the Company shall not be responsible for such non-confirmation.<br>
						③ Because the confirmation of an airline seat is its reservation but not its designation, in the event that a Traveler checks in with his/her boarding pass after purchasing an Airline Ticket, the Company shall not be responsible for the allocation of a seat.  <br>
						</p>
						
						<strong>Article 14 (Responsibilities of Travelers) </strong>
						<p>① Travelers shall present his/her opinions on the purchase of Airline Tickets before the Ticketing Deadline as announced by the Company. <br>

						</p>
						
						<strong>Article 15 (Indemnity)</strong>
						<p>In the event that the Company's fault in the sale of Airline Tickets is acknowledged and any damage is incurred by a Traveler, the Company shall indemnify for such damage and the indemnified amount shall be determined under an agreement between the Traveler and the Company. However, in the event of proving that there is no Company fault in events such as an act of God, airport status, airline status, or other situations beyond the reasonable control of either party as not otherwise provided, the Company shall not be responsible for any damages arising in such said event.</p>
