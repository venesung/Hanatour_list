						</p>
						
						<strong>Article 14 (Responsibilities of Travelers) </strong>

						</p>
						
						<strong>Article 15 (Indemnity)</strong>
						<p>In the event that the Company's fault in the sale of Airline Tickets is acknowledged and any damage is incurred by a Traveler, the Company shall indemnify for such damage and the indemnified amount shall be determined under an agreement between the Traveler and the Company.
